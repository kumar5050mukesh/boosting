    "Boosting can improve the accuracy of weak learners. By combining several weak models, boosting can create a strong model that\n",

    "Boosting can handle noisy data and outliers. By focusing on the misclassified instances in each round, boosting can learn \n",

    "\n",
    "Boosting can be computationally expensive. Because boosting trains a series of models iteratively, it can be slow and \n",
